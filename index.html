    <h3>CSS Feature Used: `filter` and `transition`</h3>
    <p>
      The profile picture above demonstrates the use of the <code>filter</code> and <code>transition</code> CSS properties.
      Initially, the image is in grayscale (<code>filter: grayscale(100%)</code>), and when hovered over, it smoothly transitions
      to full color (<code>filter: grayscale(0%)</code>) over 0.3 seconds using <code>transition: filter 0.3s ease</code>.
      This technique enhances the interactivity of the webpage while maintaining a clean and engaging design.

    <h3>HTML Feature Used: `details` and `summary`</h3>
    <p>
      The "More About Me" section above uses the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements.
      This is a built-in HTML feature that allows content to be collapsible. When the user clicks the "More About Me"
      summary, additional information is revealed, and clicking again hides it. This feature enhances user experience
      by keeping the page clean while still providing access to additional content.
